# Degradation Process
Using five methods to degrade HR image of RealSR dataset and get corresponding estimated LR, 
then comparing them with GT_LR by calculating PSNR/SSIM to valid the performance of different methonds
# Methods
Bicubic vs. Gaussian blur + bicubic vs. KernelGAN vs. Correction fliter vs. Kernel Solver
